<h1>Hello world! Welcome to my website.</h1>
  <hr>
  <p1>This is really a work in progress, but is meant to showcase my skills so far. I have some apps and widgets on here for you to check out.</p1><br><br>
  <p1>The software that I used to make the majority of this site is Django, a python application. I will be adding JavaScript and some CSS,  to make this website look and feel better, in the near future.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> The <a href="{% url 'polls:index' %}">Voting Poll App</a> was the first application I made through a tutorial on Django's Website.</li><br>
      <li>Now I am working through making the <a href="{% url 'post:index' %}">Blog Post App</a> in a simlar manner to the voting poll app. But this time with addable replies and like and dislike buttons!</li>
    </ul>
